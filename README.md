<!-- 
This code creates a dynamic personal dashboard webpage that provides real-time information about cryptocurrency and weather. Here's an overview of what the code performs:

HTML Structure:

Sets up the basic structure of the webpage with HTML elements.
Defines areas for displaying cryptocurrency information, current time, weather, and author information.
CSS Styling:

Defines styles for various elements of the webpage to improve its appearance and layout.
JavaScript Functionality:

Fetches a random image of BMW from the Unsplash API and sets it as the background of the webpage. If fetching fails, it sets a default background image.
Fetches data about Ethereum cryptocurrency from the CoinGecko API and updates the DOM with this data, including the cryptocurrency's name, current price, 24-hour high, and 24-hour low.
Updates the current time displayed on the webpage every second.
Fetches weather data based on the user's current location using geolocation. It then updates the DOM with weather information, including the weather icon, temperature, and city name.
Handles errors gracefully using try...catch blocks, logging any errors to the console if fetching data fails.
Overall, this code creates an interactive dashboard that combines cryptocurrency and weather data, providing users with relevant and up-to-date information in a visually appealing manner.
